Key capabilities:

* **Lightning-fast prototyping** - Go from concept to working agent graph in minutes, not days
* **Universal LLM support** - Seamlessly switch between providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) with unified interface
* **Flexible agent choreography** - Design directed workflows with our intuitive Graph system
* **Powerful augmentation** - Enhance your agents with RAG, memory sharing, and multi-agent collaboration
* **Real-world integration** - Execute custom Python functions based on agent decisions with our Tools capability
* **Production-ready performance** - Built for both synchronous and asynchronous operations at scale
